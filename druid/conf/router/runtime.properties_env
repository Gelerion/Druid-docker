# Optional
# The Apache Druid (incubating) Router process can be used to route queries to different Broker processes. By default, 
# the broker routes queries based on how Rules are set up. For example, if 1 month of recent data is loaded into a hot cluster, 
# queries that fall within the recent month can be routed to a dedicated set of brokers. Queries outside this range are routed 
# to another set of brokers. This set up provides query isolation such that queries for more important data are not impacted 
# by queries for less important data.
